There are N Bus stoppages from city X to city Y. Stoppage(1) is in city X and stoppage(N) is in city Y. You are given an array A of positive integers
which represents that a Bus starting from stoppage(i) can move to any stoppage(j) where (i+1<=j<=i+A[i]) both inclusive.
Professor P is a very lazy person.
He has to take his lecture in city Y. Professor P knows that he has to change 
the Buses to reach city B because it is possible that a Bus may not move from 
stoppage(i) to city Y directly.
Professor P does not want to change the Buses many times so he decided to choose the Bus stoppage optimally to reach city Y 
or stoppage(N) with minimum Buses to change.
Since Professor P is a very lazy person so he asks for your help to compute the minimum number of buses that he 
has to change to reach city Y.



NOTE : All indexing are 1 based.
 


INPUT :


First line contains a single integer N (number of stoppages from city X to city Y). 
Second line contains N space separated integers of array A.
Next line contains a single integer Q (number of query to ask).
Next Q lines contains a single integer (I) 
denoting the initial stoppage of Professor P.



OUTPUT :


For each Q, print a single integer in new line denoting the minimum number of buses that 
have to be changed by Professor P to reach city Y from stoppage(I).

Explanation :


Testcase 1 :
For first example, initial position of Professor P is stoppage(1), from stoppage(1) he can move to any stoppage
 from stoppage(1+1) to stoppage(1+3).
Professor P can choose stoppage(2),stoppage(3) or stoppage(4).
If he chooses stoppage(3), then he can move to any stoppage from stoppage(3+1) 
to stoppage(3+4). He just has to reach stoppage(N), so his path to reach city Y will be 1-->3-->5.
First Bus to reach stoppage(3) and second Bus to reach 
stoppage(5).

Testcase 2 :


For second example,one of the optimal path will be 2-->3-->5 for first test case and 4-->5 for second test case.
