professor p has n students in his class.he has maintain the records of marks that each student has got in the final exam,where a[i] represents the 
total marks of the ith student.any ith student will be considered as passed iff [(a[i] xor k)>m].
professor p has to compute all possible subarray such that first student of the subarray has passed the exam and last student of the subarray has 
failed the exam.
professor p wants you to calculate [1/(number of such subarray)]%1000000007.
 
INPUT :
First line contains a single integer T(number of testcases).First line of each testcase contains three integers N(number of students),k and m.
Second line of each testcase contains n space seperated integers representing the marks of ith student.


OUTPUT :
For each testcase print a single integer in a new line (1/(number of defined subarray))%1000000007 
or print -1 if there exist no such subarray.
 
CONSTRAINTS :
1<=T<=100
1<=a[i]<=100000
1<=N<=100000
1<=k<=100000
1<=m<=100000
